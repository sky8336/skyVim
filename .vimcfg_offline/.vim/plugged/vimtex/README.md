## Requirements

vimtex requires Vim version 8.0.1453 or neovim version 0.4.3. The requirements
were updated in July 2020 after the release of vimtex 1.0. If you are stuck
on older versions of Vim or neovim, then you should not use the most recent
version of vimtex, but instead remain at the v1.0 tag.

Some features require external tools. For example, the default compiler backend relies on [latexmk](http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/).
Users are encouraged to read the requirements section in the [documentation](doc/vimtex.txt) (`:h vimtex-requirements`).

## Installation

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), then add the
following line to your `vimrc` file:

```vim
Plug 'lervag/vimtex'
```

Or use some other plugin manager:
* [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
* [neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
* [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

If you use the new package feature in Vim, please note the following:
* Make sure to read and understand the package feature: `:help package`!
* Use the `/pack/foo/start` subdirectory to make sure the filetype plugin is
  automatically loaded for the `tex` filetypes.
* Helptags are not generated automatically. Run `:helptags` to generate them.
* Please note that by default Vim puts custom `/start/` plugin directories at
  the end of the `&runtimepath`. This means the built in filetype plugin is
  loaded, which prevents Vimtex from loading. See
  [#1413](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/1413) for two suggested
  solutions to this. To see which scripts are loaded and in which order, use
  `:scriptnames`.
* For more information on how to use the Vim native package solution, see
  [here](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/9522/what-is-the-vim8-package-feature-and-how-should-i-use-it) and [here](https://shapeshed.com/vim-packages/).

## Quick Start

The following is a simple guide for how to use vimtex. It only displays the
most basic features. Users are _strongly_ encouraged to read or at least skim
through the documentation to learn about the different features and
possibilities provided by vimtex (see [`:h vimtex`](doc/vimtex.txt)).

## Features

Below is a list of features offered by vimtex.  The features are accessible as
both commands and mappings.  The mappings generally start with
`<localleader>l`, but if desired one can disable default mappings to define
custom mappings.  All features are enabled by default, but each feature may be
disabled if desired.

See the documentation for a thorough introduction to vimtex (e.g. `:h vimtex`).

## Other relevant plugins

Even though vimtex provides a lot of nice features for working with LaTeX
documents, there are several features that are better served by other,
dedicated plugins. For a more detailed listing of these, please see [`:help
vimtex-non-features`](doc/vimtex.txt#L156).

### Linting and syntax checking

  * [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale)
  * [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake)
  * [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic)

### Snippets and templates

  * [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)
  * [neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim)

### Tag navigation

  * [vim-gutentags](https://github.com/ludovicchabant/vim-gutentags)

## Alternatives

The following are some alternative LaTeX plugins for Vim:

* [LaTeX-Suite](http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net)

    The main difference between vimtex and LaTeX-Suite (aka vim-latex) is
    probably that vimtex does not try to implement a full fledged IDE for LaTeX
    inside Vim. E.g.:

    * vimtex does not provide a full snippet feature, because this is better
      handled by [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) or
      [neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim) or similar snippet
      engines.
    * vimtex builds upon Vim principles: It provides text objects for
      environments, inline math, it provides motions for sections and
      paragraphs
    * vimtex uses `latexmk`, `latexrun`, `tectonic` or `arara` for compilation
      with a callback feature to get instant feedback on compilation errors
    * vimtex is very modular: if you don't like a feature, you can turn it off.

* [LaTeX-Box](https://github.com/LaTeX-Box-Team/LaTeX-Box)

    vimtex currently has most of the features of LaTeX-Box, as well as
    some additional ones. See [here](#features) for a relatively complete list
    of features.

    One particular feature that LaTeX-Box has but vimtex misses, is the ability
    to do single-shot compilation _with callback_. This functionality was
    removed because it adds a lot of complexity for relatively little gain
    (IMHO).

* [AutomaticTexPlugin](http://atp-vim.sourceforge.net)
* [vim-latex-live-preview](https://github.com/xuhdev/vim-latex-live-preview)
