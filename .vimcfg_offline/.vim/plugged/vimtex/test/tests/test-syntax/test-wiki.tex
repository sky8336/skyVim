== This can be a section ==

Did it ''work''? Apparently '''yes''', though not ''all'' wiki markup is supported.

* Lists!!
* More '''lists'''!!!

No nested lists though.

Normal \LaTeX{} stuff should still work. Just be careful of lists, it seems.

=== I can haz subsections plz? ===

# numbered lists
# second item

\nowikimarkup

Back to normal \LaTeX{} behavior now. '''This is still typeset in normal weight.'''
