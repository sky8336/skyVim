# vimtex

vimtex is a [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) plugin that provides support for writing
LaTeX documents. It is based on
[LaTeX-Box](https://github.com/LaTeX-Box-Team/LaTeX-Box) and it shares a
similar goal: to provide a simple and lightweight LaTeX plugin. It has been
rewritten from scratch to provide a more modern and modular code base. See
[here](#alternatives) for some more comments on the difference between vimtex
and other LaTeX plugins for Vim.

## Installation

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), then add the
following line to your `vimrc` file:

```vim
Plug 'lervag/vimtex'
```

Or use some other plugin manager:
- [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
- [neobundle](https://github.com/Shougo/neobundle.vim)
- [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)

If you use the new package feature in Vim, please note that it does not always put the runtimepaths in the right order. This may lead to an issue where vimtex does not seem to load. See [this comment in #1413](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/1413#issuecomment-513253660) for a suggested solution.

## Quick Start

The following is a simple guide for how to use vimtex. It only displays the
most basic features. Users are _strongly_ encouraged to read or at least skim
through the documentation to learn about the different features and
possibilities provided by vimtex (see [`:h vimtex`](doc/vimtex.txt)).

Note: Vimtex supports neovim; see the [related wiki
section](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/wiki/introduction#neovim) or `:h
vimtex-faq-neovim`.

## Features

Below is a list of features offered by vimtex.  The features are accessible as
both commands and mappings.  The mappings generally start with
`<localleader>l`, but if desired one can disable default mappings to define
custom mappings.  All features are enabled by default, but each feature may be
disabled if desired.

  [latexmk](http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc/),
  [latexrun](https://github.com/aclements/latexrun),

  [arara](https://github.com/cereda/arara)

See the documentation for a thorough introduction to vimtex (e.g. `:h vimtex`).

## Other relevant plugins

Even though vimtex provides a lot of nice features for working with LaTeX
documents, there are several features that are better served by other,
dedicated plugins. For a more detailed listing of these, please see [`:help
vimtex-non-features`](doc/vimtex.txt#L156).

### Linting and syntax checking

  * [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale)
  * [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake)
  * [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic)

### Snippets and templates

  * [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)
  * [neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim)

### Tag navigation

  * [vim-gutentags](https://github.com/ludovicchabant/vim-gutentags)

## Alternatives

The following are some alternative LaTeX plugins for Vim:

- [LaTeX-Box](https://github.com/LaTeX-Box-Team/LaTeX-Box)

    vimtex currently has most of the features of LaTeX-Box, as well as
    some additional ones. See [here](#features) for a relatively complete list
    of features.

    One particular feature that LaTeX-Box has but vimtex misses, is the ability
    to do single-shot compilation _with callback_. This functionality was
    removed because it adds a lot of complexity for relatively little gain
    (IMHO).

    Note: LaTeX-Box is included with
    [vim-polyglot](https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot). Some users are not
    quite aware of this and end up trying vimtex with LaTeX-Box enabled. This
    will not work --- please disable LaTeX-Box first!

- [LaTeX-Suite](http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net)

    The main difference between vimtex and LaTeX-Suite (aka vim-latex) is
    probably that vimtex does not try to implement a full fledged IDE for LaTeX
    inside Vim. E.g.:

    - vimtex does not provide a full snippet feature, because this is better
      handled by [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) or
      [neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim) or similar snippet
      engines.
    - vimtex builds upon Vim principles: It provides text objects for
      environments, inline math, it provides motions for sections and
      paragraphs
    - vimtex uses `latexmk`, `latexrun`, `tectonic` or `arara` for compilation
      with a callback feature to get instant feedback on compilation errors
    - vimtex is very modular: if you don't like a feature, you can turn it off.
